Ok so I just wanted to tell you as to what I have done for this lab and how I constructed my pages:
1. Almost all the button are responsive with some links tied to it so you can click on most of the buttons and social media icons even.
2. I have a different signup page too, which you can open through the home signup tab option by clicking on it.
3. I would strongly recommend to open my webpages in chrome as I have designed them according to that and they look really good but they look good regardless too.
4. Lastly please have a look at it, hope you like it and it makes into the top websites for BONUS =) .
