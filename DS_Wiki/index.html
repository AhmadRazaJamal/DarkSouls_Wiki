        ABOUT DARK SOULS :
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            Dark Souls is an action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware and published by Namco Bandai Games. A spiritual successor to FromSoftware's Demon's Souls, the game is the second installment in the Souls series. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in Japan by FromSoftware in September 2011 and worldwide by Namco Bandai Games in the following month. Dark Souls takes place in the fictional kingdom of Lordran, where players assume the role of a cursed undead character who begins a pilgrimage to discover the fate of their kind.

        </h3>
        <p>
        The world of Dark Souls is a world of cycles. Kingdoms rise and fall, ages come and go, and even time can end and restart as the flame fades and is renewed. These cycles are linked to the First Flame, a mysterious manifestation of life that divides and defines separate states such as heat and cold, or life and death. As the First Flame fades, these differences also begin to fade, such as life and death having little distinction, and humans becoming Undead. The onset of an Age of Dark, the time when the First Flame has fully died, is marked by endless nights, rampant undeath, time, space, and reality breaking down, lands collapsing and converging on one another, people mutating into monsters, darkness covering the world, and the Gods losing their power. To avoid this and prolong the Age of Fire, the bearer of a powerful soul must "link" themselves to the First Flame, becoming the fuel for another age. <a href = "https://darksouls.wiki.fextralife.com/Lore" >

        <h3>
        MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH DARK SOULS : 
        </h3>
        
        <p>
        My first dark souls experience began with dark souls 3 and suprisngly not the earlier games of the series as I was introduced to the genre by a friend of mine who was a big fan of the series and the genre itself. After a punishing and extreme gameplay that I got from Dark souls 3, I got into the hang of punsihing my self with gruesomely hard gameplay. With it slowly becoming an addiction to take on challanges and beating one hard boss after another gaining not only experience along the way but also learining about the lore and beautiful world of dark souls. With the matching artistic aspect of dark souls to my own preference I was absorbed by the game. I set out to finish the rest of the souls game as well, I was finishing the games in decending order henceforth. The games not only brought me to appreciate the beautiful world of dark souls and its lore, it also made me appreciate the work the community and the developers had put into their game and how it had taken into context every aspect of their fans love for the genre.
